------------------
Doctoral student with research experience in the design and implementation of robust and privacy-preserving optimization algorithms for complex networked dynamic systems, with a focus on fault-tolerance and differential privacy for energy systems. Advanced understanding of linear algebra, statistics, stochastic processes, optimization, and probability theory. Skilled in time-series predictive modeling, causal inference, and hypothetical testing. I am looking for quantitative research/data ML science roles in Spring 2025.
